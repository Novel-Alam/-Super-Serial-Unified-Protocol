# **Protocol Library Documentation**

## **Overview**

The Protocol Library I created provides a robust and flexible serial communication protocol combining the features of SPI, I2C, and CAN. It supports a master-minion architecture with multi-master capability, full-duplex communication, address-based messaging, and differential signaling. This documentation outlines the features, functions, and usage of the library.

## **Features**

1. **Master-Minion Architecture**:
   - **Master Mode**: Initiates communication, sends data, performs address-based arbitration.
   - **Minion Mode**: Receives data, processes incoming messages, and can send data back.

2. **Full-Duplex Communication**:
   - Allows simultaneous sending and receiving of data, improving system efficiency.

3. **Address-Based Communication**:
   - Supports address-based messaging, enabling specific communication between master and minions.

4. **Differential Signaling**:
   - Uses differential pairs (similar to CAN) for extended range and noise immunity.

5. **Multi-Master Support**:
   - Implements bus arbitration to allow multiple masters to share the communication bus, based on address priority.

6. **Interrupt-Driven Reception**:
   - Uses interrupts for efficient data reception at clock rising edges, with buffering to handle incoming data.

7. **Customizable Timing**:
   - Timer configurations can be adjusted based on system requirements.

## **API Functions**

### **Master Functions**

- **`void Protocol_Master_Init(uint8_t address);`**
  - Initializes the protocol in master mode.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `address`: The address of the master device.
  
- **`void Protocol_Master_SendByte(uint8_t data);`**
  - Sends a byte of data to the minion(s) using differential signaling.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `data`: The byte of data to send.
  
- **`void Protocol_Master_SendAddress(uint8_t address);`**
  - Sends an address to select a specific minion.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `address`: The address of the target minion.
  
- **`void Protocol_Master_Arbitrate(void);`**
  - Performs bus arbitration to ensure access to the bus.
  
- **`uint8_t Protocol_Master_ReadByte(void);`**
  - Reads a byte of data from the buffer.
  - **Returns**: The received byte of data.

### **Minion Functions**

- **`void Protocol_Minion_Init(uint8_t address);`**
  - Initializes the protocol in minion mode.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `address`: The address of the minion device.
  
- **`uint8_t Protocol_Minion_ReadByte(void);`**
  - Reads a byte of data from the buffer.
  - **Returns**: The received byte of data.
  
- **`void Protocol_Minion_SendByte(uint8_t data);`**
  - Sends a byte of data to the master using differential signaling.
  - **Parameters**: 
    - `data`: The byte of data to send.
  
- **`void Protocol_Minion_ProcessData(void);`**
  - Processes incoming data after it has been received.

### **Interrupt Handlers**

- **`void Protocol_IRQHandler(void);`**
  - Handles EXTI interrupts triggered by the clock signal.
  - Processes incoming bits and updates the buffer.

## **Configuration and Setup**

### **Pin Definitions**

- **Master:**
  - `TX_H`: High signal pin for differential signaling (e.g., PA0).
  - `TX_L`: Low signal pin for differential signaling (e.g., PA1).
  - `CLK`: Clock signal pin (e.g., PA2).

- **Minion:**
  - `RX_H`: High signal pin for differential signaling (e.g., PB0).
  - `RX_L`: Low signal pin for differential signaling (e.g., PB1).

### **Buffer Size**

- The buffer size for received data is defined by `BUFFER_SIZE` and can be adjusted as needed.

### **Timing Configuration**

- The clock and timer settings are configured in `Timer_Init()` and can be customized based on system requirements.

## **Usage Example**

### **Master Example**

```c
#include "protocol.h"

int main(void) {
    Protocol_Master_Init(MASTER_ADDRESS);
    Protocol_Master_SendAddress(MINION_ADDRESS);

    while (1) {
        Protocol_Master_SendByte(0x55); // Example data
        for (volatile int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++);  // Delay
    }
}
```

### **Minion Example**

```c
#include "protocol.h"

int main(void) {
    Protocol_Minion_Init(MINION_ADDRESS);

    while (1) {
        uint8_t received_data = Protocol_Minion_ReadByte();
        // Process received data
        for (volatile int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++);  // Delay
    }
}
```

## **Interrupts and Handling**

- **EXTI2_IRQHandler**: Handles the rising edge of the clock signal, processes received bits, and updates the buffer.

## **Additional Notes**

- Ensure to adapt the GPIO and timer settings based on your specific STM32 microcontroller model and clock configuration.
- The library uses simple delay loops for timing. For more precise timing, consider using hardware timers or other mechanisms.

## **Troubleshooting**

- **Communication Issues**: Verify pin connections and check if differential signaling is correctly implemented.
- **Buffer Overflow**: Ensure that the buffer size is adequate for your application, and monitor buffer indices to avoid overflows.
